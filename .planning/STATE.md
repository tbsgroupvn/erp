# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-18)

**Core value:** The order lifecycle (17+ statuses across 9 FSMs) must be bulletproof — no state can be skipped, no unauthorized role can mutate data, and no query can bottleneck under production load.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Backend Error Standardization

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 9 (Backend Error Standardization)
Plan: 1 of 4 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-18 — Completed Plan 01-01 (error handling infrastructure)

Progress: [▓░░░░░░░░░] 3%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 6min
- Total execution time: 0.1 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-backend-error-standardization | 1/4 | 6min | 6min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (6min)
- Trend: starting

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 9-phase fine-grained structure chosen — error handling foundation first, testing validation last
- [Roadmap]: Input validation (SEC-04/05/06) placed before RBAC audit to avoid rate-limit gaps during security changes
- [Roadmap]: Business rule enforcement (DAT-07 through DAT-11) separated from FSM verification — FSM tests verify transitions, business rules verify domain gates
- [01-01]: ErrorCode as const object with string values (not enum) for runtime flexibility and tree-shaking
- [01-01]: SentryExceptionFilter formats 500 response for unknown exceptions instead of re-throwing
- [01-01]: All filter registration consolidated to APP_FILTER in app.module.ts (removed useGlobalFilters from main.ts)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 5]: RBAC audit requires business stakeholder input — 22 roles cannot be mapped to endpoints from code alone (flagged in research)
- [Phase 8]: Index creation on production tables needs staging validation before production deployment
