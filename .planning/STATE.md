# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-18)

**Core value:** The order lifecycle (17+ statuses across 9 FSMs) must be bulletproof — no state can be skipped, no unauthorized role can mutate data, and no query can bottleneck under production load.
**Current focus:** Phase 2: Frontend Error Handling (COMPLETE)

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 9 (Frontend Error Handling) - COMPLETE
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase (02-03 done)
Status: Phase Complete
Last activity: 2026-03-18 — Completed Plan 02-03 (remove duplicate toast.error from 47 hook files)

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 7
- Average duration: 5min
- Total execution time: 0.65 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-backend-error-standardization | 4/4 | 20min | 5min |
| 02-frontend-error-handling | 3/3 | 19min | 6min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-04 (5min), 02-01 (4min), 02-02 (5min), 02-03 (10min)
- Trend: stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 9-phase fine-grained structure chosen — error handling foundation first, testing validation last
- [Roadmap]: Input validation (SEC-04/05/06) placed before RBAC audit to avoid rate-limit gaps during security changes
- [Roadmap]: Business rule enforcement (DAT-07 through DAT-11) separated from FSM verification — FSM tests verify transitions, business rules verify domain gates
- [01-01]: ErrorCode as const object with string values (not enum) for runtime flexibility and tree-shaking
- [01-01]: SentryExceptionFilter formats 500 response for unknown exceptions instead of re-throwing
- [01-01]: All filter registration consolidated to APP_FILTER in app.module.ts (removed useGlobalFilters from main.ts)
- [01-02]: auth.service.ts constructor env check converted to DomainException (acceptance criteria requires zero raw throws)
- [01-02]: query-analyzer.service.ts uses ForbiddenException (production block) + BadRequestException (input validation) instead of DomainException
- [01-03]: wsError() auto-generates requestId with 'ws-' prefix + 8-char hex for WebSocket-originated errors
- [01-03]: extractErrorCode() tries JSON parse, then string match against known ErrorCode values, fallback to JOB_PROCESSING_FAILED
- [01-03]: FailedJobCaptureService retrieves full Job object on failure for metadata extraction (graceful fallback if removed)
- [01-04]: accounting.service.ts provider API errors use HttpStatus.BAD_GATEWAY (502) for upstream failures
- [01-04]: batch-job.service.ts cancellation signal uses DomainException with getResponse() message check
- [01-04]: Added AUTOMATION_ACTION_FAILED and BATCH_IMPORT_VALIDATION_ERROR to ErrorCode registry
- [02-01]: Vietnamese diacritics used in error messages matching codebase convention (Unicode escapes in source)
- [02-01]: Sentry 401/403 errors filtered in beforeSend to avoid noise from auth flow
- [02-01]: Mutation toast shows requestId as description for support contact tracing
- [02-02]: global-error.tsx uses window.location.href (full URL) since Next.js router is crashed; others use pathname
- [02-02]: ErrorBoundary uses typeof window guard for SSR safety in componentDidCatch
- [02-03]: Kept toast.error in useTestAutomationRule onSuccess -- business logic, not duplicate error handler
- [02-03]: Preserved optimistic rollback in useOptimisticTaskStatus onError, removed only toast.error line
- [02-03]: Removed orphaned sonner imports from use-notifications.ts and use-ai-assistant.ts

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 5]: RBAC audit requires business stakeholder input — 22 roles cannot be mapped to endpoints from code alone (flagged in research)
- [Phase 8]: Index creation on production tables needs staging validation before production deployment
