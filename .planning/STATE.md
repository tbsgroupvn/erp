# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-18)

**Core value:** The order lifecycle (17+ statuses across 9 FSMs) must be bulletproof — no state can be skipped, no unauthorized role can mutate data, and no query can bottleneck under production load.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Backend Error Standardization

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 9 (Backend Error Standardization)
Plan: 0 of 2 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-18 — Roadmap created with 9 phases covering 31 requirements

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 9-phase fine-grained structure chosen — error handling foundation first, testing validation last
- [Roadmap]: Input validation (SEC-04/05/06) placed before RBAC audit to avoid rate-limit gaps during security changes
- [Roadmap]: Business rule enforcement (DAT-07 through DAT-11) separated from FSM verification — FSM tests verify transitions, business rules verify domain gates

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 5]: RBAC audit requires business stakeholder input — 22 roles cannot be mapped to endpoints from code alone (flagged in research)
- [Phase 8]: Index creation on production tables needs staging validation before production deployment
